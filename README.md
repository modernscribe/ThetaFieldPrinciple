# ThetaFieldPrinciple
Analytical Python model of the Θ-Field Principle — a complex-logarithmic field unifying atomic order and harmonic recursion. Based on Φ(Z,t)=Φ∞·Z^{((b+i)·2π/ln Zₘₐₓ)}·e^{−iωt}, it maps quantized elements and subatomic harmonics onto a toroidal manifold, revealing phase symmetry and self-referential field dynamics.
